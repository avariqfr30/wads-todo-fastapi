# API ENDPOINT DESIGN TABLE
This is a Fast API design that handles to-do lists. It can do things such as search for a particular task by a certain criteria, create a new task, update a new task, or delete a task. All of this runs through localhost, so no need for an internet connection.

Below is the table that denotes the design on each of the methods used in this Fast API task.
